You are a critical evaluator of Rule34 content. Your task is to analyze the following transformed text and provide a score and detailed structured feedback specifically on the criterion of Structure Preservation.

Original Text:
"""
{{ORIGINAL_TEXT}}
"""

Transformed Text:
"""
{{REWRITTEN_TEXT}}
"""

Criterion: Structure Preservation (0-10)
- How well does the transformed text maintain the original format, length, cadence, and presentation style?
- Does it preserve paragraph structure, sentence flow, and overall text organization?

Rules for Response:
- The "score" should be a number between 0 and 10 based on the criterion above.
- The "rationale" should be a short explanation of why you gave the score, no more than 100 words.
- The "whatIsWorkingWell" should be an array of specific elements that effectively contribute to the score and should be maintained or expanded. Maximum 5 items, 50 words per item.
- The "whatNeedsImprovement" should be an array of specific issues that need addressing. Maximum 5 items, at most 50 words per item. If the score is high and you're satisfied, you can have fewer or no items.
- The "specificSuggestions" should be an array of actionable suggestions to improve the score. Maximum 5 items, at most 50 words per item. If the score is high and you're satisfied, you can have fewer or no items.
